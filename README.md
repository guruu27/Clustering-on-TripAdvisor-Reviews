## Clustering on TripAdvisor Reviews

### Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs clustering analysis on TripAdvisor reviews. The goal of this project is to group similar reviews together to identify common themes and insights from user feedback.

### Contents
- **Clustering on TripAdvisor Reviews.ipynb**: The main notebook containing the data analysis and clustering process.

### Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the TripAdvisor review data for analysis.
- **Clustering Techniques**: Applying various clustering algorithms such as K-means and Hierarchical clustering.
- **Visualization**: Visualizing the clusters to interpret the results and gain insights.

### Requirements
To run the notebook, you need the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install the required libraries using the following command:
