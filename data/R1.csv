El Catrin,23-12-2023,50,Delicious time had by all!,"Had a brilliant time thanks to Francesca, our brave hostess who de escalated a very irate and rude customer. Her quick thinking and patience was truly appreciated! Our server, Christi, was just as fabulous, making sure to check in with us! The food was delicious as always! Really impressed with the Tacos al Pastor! A must try! One of our favourite places to dine!"
El Catrin,18-12-2023,50,Excellent Mexican food!!,"Amazing food! We love Mexican and agreed this is now our favorite Mexican place in the GTA. The guac was made table side and was fresh and tasty. The fish tacos, the steak and the tacos de papa were all excellent. As well as the...More"
El Catrin,14-11-2023,50,Good and tasty,"A very nice restaurant in the Distillery district of Toronto. A lot to chose from on the menu, spicy and tasty. That goes for the drinks as well, their Margaritas are really good. Service was good, very spontaneous and fun. Not too expensive as well."
El Catrin,21-10-2023,20,disappointing,It was okay.. we had reservations at 9:45 we arrived at 8:30 and asked if we would be able to be seated early the lady was short and very rude to me and boyfriend. Once we got in the guacamole was fantastic and our server was super sweet! unfortunately the birria tacos where very dry and salty the tortillas where stale just terrible overall. This is very disappointing as last time we were here (april 2023) the tacos were amazing and the overall experience was better.
El Catrin,09-10-2023,30,Very mediocre lunch,Boss wasn't on site??? Regular chef not there? Went for lunch. Not even an eye contact from the greeter as I walked in. Just busy looking at her papers. Waited for her. Said I was with a group and she just pointed and told me where instead of walking me there. Very nice ambience ruined by poor food. Tortillas for the guacamole were very salty! Tacos were very salty! Churros were dried to the point of a hard crunch in the mouth! Man...
El Catrin,04-10-2023,50,Wonderful service! Delicious Food! Great atmosphere!,"My partner and I went there for a birthday lunch sitting on the patio. Victoria, our waitress was amazing, attentive and knew the menu very well. She made excellent recommendations for us, which we enjoyed... The guacamole was delicious made en la Mesa... The wait staff was great. A great meal and we will return for sure! Frank C. Toronto"
El Catrin,02-10-2023,40,In the distillery historic district,"We were looking for a distillery related restaurant. The closest we could get were a couple breweries that were closed for private events. We ended at a Mexican restaurant, and it had many different choices of food that I don't see in the United States. The food was good and Elle was a good and attentive server."
El Catrin,02-10-2023,30,Something different,"We happened upon this place while visiting Torontoâ€™s Distillery District. It was lunch time, the weather was spectacular, and they had a huge outdoor patio that looked to be popular, so we stopped here. There isnâ€™t a lot of shaded areas, but the umbrellas helped. We shared their popular GUACAMOLE EN LA MESA which was pretty tasty, as well as the CRISPY TACOS DE PAPA, which was different, but goodâ€¦.I liked it, but the sauce wasnâ€™t my favourite. This place also wasnâ€™t easy on the wallet. We did enjoy our lunch in the sunshine and would recommend to friends."
El Catrin,25-09-2023,50,Thank you for the exceptional service.,"Good tacos,guacamole,spicy condiments,good choices of cocktails,great teamwork and outstanding service.  Look for Michelle when you dine in at El Catrin.She is very experience and provided efficient service.Recommeded mangolada which is really good. Suhani give us a comfortable seat closer to the bar.It was fun watching the bar tenders while making drinks for this guests.Great teamwork.  Overall ambiance was nice.From the entrance to the patio,dim lights and wall painting inside makes you feel like youâ€™re in Mexico for a moment.Great style.  Thank you for the El Catrin staff for making our night really special."
El Catrin,25-09-2023,40,Make reservations on-line 2 weeks ahead for the patio!,"We have a lot of opportunity to enjoy Mexico and catrina related memorabilia. Perhaps the restaurant could repair some of it's decorative items (hint, hint). Our dinner was quite spicy but delicious and the sangria went well with it. There are no blended margaritas or food that people traditionally expect so look at the menu ahead of time and try some new items. The patio was delightful and service good until we needed to pay the check and then we had to chase him down. Seating near the fire pit is the best seat in the house to me. Good luck if you try to walk in."
El Catrin,20-09-2023,50,"Great for Coeliacs. Ask for Kylie, she was brilliant","Kylie served us, amazing, attentive and totally understood the importance of a GF diet for a Coeliac. She answered all my questions and made me feel assured. The food was excellent. Go to this place, itâ€™s fantastic"
El Catrin,04-09-2023,30,great location but missed the mark on dinner,Located in the Distillery District is a great location for a good meal. Unfortunately the restaurant is just average at best. The tuna and Octopus tostada were small and not very flavorful. The mojitos mulled mint was not mulled very well. It was a disappointing dinner.

El Catrin,21-08-2023,10,This restaurant discriminates and is ver y unprofessional,"If I could give this please zero stars I would. This place made us feel very embarrassed and discriminated against because we had young children that will join us for dinner. It started with us asking the hostess for a table for nine people. They told us 45 minutes so we waited around in nearby bars for them to call or text us. One hour and a half goes by and we hear nothing from them. So we went back to the restaurant to check in person to see if it was ready. The hostess told us it would be just a few minutes while they set up the table for us. 20 minutes has gone by and at this point we have witnessed five other parties that were seated before us some with groups of five people some with groups of four. At this point we were all very frustrated because the babies were getting very impatient and still waiting. I approach the hostess and asked her how much longer because we have seen all these parties getting seated a head of us and I understand that we are a little bit larger group, but it should not take this long. She tried to tell us that is such a big group and they need time to set up. I told her thatâ€™s not what I want to hear 25 minutes waiting for tables to be set up. If you donâ€™t want us to be seated because there are many kids and you think thatâ€™s a lot of work for the restaurant then you can let us know instead of having us wait there like idiots. Miraculously right at that moment, our tables were ready. We walked past so many empty tables that couldâ€™ve been our seats (which was a huge slap in the face) but instead we were seated in the corner where they put together a round table with a square table, and proceed to have us squeeze in there. After trying to set and realizing that they did not spend any time putting the table together and that the real reason was they did not want to serve us because we had kids. We decided that we did not want to stay because at this point we as parents felt very hurt and embarrassed that we were treated this way in this restaurant. Itâ€™s discrimination and we did not feel right spending any money at this restaurant."
