"November 11, 2019",30,Average at best,"Group of 5 went here for dinner. This place has not been properly cleaned in years. The floors are slippery from lack of ""standard practice"" cleaning. Food - Good Service - Nothing special Will NOT go back."

"December 4, 2018",10,Good Food but Horrible Service,"Not from Toronto, found this place while adventuring around and decided to try it. Walked in and was greeted right away and sat down. So far so good, they explained the all you can eat sushi, they give you a piece of paper and you...More"

"July 10, 2017",40,Not bad for a buffet,"Place looks a bit rundown, service was so-so, sushi rolls were average, sashimi and rice bowls were pretty good. Food was seved quickly and beer was cold. About what you should expect at an all-you-can eat restaurant."
"May 18, 2017",10,Really,"I've had sushi around the world and this place ranked with those places in northern Saskatchewan, lol. If you want substandard fare in downtown TO, and terrible, grumpy and pushy wait people then this is your place. I won't be back. Mind you I'll walk...More"

"April 8, 2017",40,"Delicious sushi, quick, though curt service.","We totally enjoyed the food at Kyoto House, the eel being the biggest hit at our table. The fish was fresh and delicious.

"July 24, 2016",30,Low price vs questionable quality,"I went for a quick lunch with co-workers expecting a reasonable ""all you can eat"" Japanese restaurant. Good points: - Good location - If you want to eat a lot not paying much, ok it may be the place - Diversity of basic dishes. Bad...More"
"July 17, 2016",30,Kyoto house has gone down hill but used to be great.,Will keep it short and sweet - if you're looking for quick/cheap/relatively decent AYCE sushi then this is the place to go. I've visited (2 of us) about 3-4 times in the past couple years and nothing compares to the first time. Service has gone...More
"July 14, 2016",40,Sushi tasty !,"Well, very good and cheap sushis. Lot of fresh fish and avocados. 12$ for lunch and 20$ for dinner. I really like it. But the service isn't really good... There is a lot of waitress, wich is good. But please... learn to smile !"
"July 13, 2016",50,Good food and value,"Was looking to find a place that has sushi, and came across Kyoto walking around. The all you can eat format is great, simply fill out the order form - and the friendly staff will bring it out shortly. In my opinion, there is enough...More"
"July 9, 2016",40,Great for the price,Sushi selection and quality isn't amazing but for the price you can't have higher expectations. I come here when Japango is full and I have a sushi craving. There are always tables available.
"June 29, 2016",40,Take out service was quick and food was good.,"Visited late one evening for take-out. Sushi was fresh, tasty and came with a bowl of miso soup and a small salad for under $10. Very convenient for the Hilton Hotel on Chestnut Street."

"March 20, 2016",30,The price is good but the food...,"Well, I went there twice and, to be honest, I didn't like the food. I know many people who like there so you should go and try it for yourself. It is cheap, though."
"February 21, 2016",50,Bento box lunch,"Quick and efficient service. Very reasonable prices and great food. Classic bento; fresh salad, rolls, gyoza and teriyaki. A much wider range exists but we are Japanese newbies."
"February 1, 2016",30,Not bad for the price,"This is very typical Chinese AYCE sushi place so you shouldn't expect fancy sushi. $11 AYCE, where else you can get same rate? Ad it's right in the centre of downtown. Rolls are messy, sushi is not firm enough to lift with chopsticks yet fish...More"
"November 7, 2015",30,Not bad for the price,"After years of walking past Kyoto house, I recently visited the restaurant twice, both for lunch. Within 1 week, the price of AYCE sushi went from $11.99 to $12.99, which is still pretty good for AYCE. The restaurant was very busy both times probably around...More"
"September 19, 2015",30,Bring Your Own Soy Sauce,"I have visited this place on and off for the past few years. It is famous for inconsistent quality, not-too-friendly service, a mostly university student clientele, and watered down soy sauce! I'm baffled with the constant business they receive, at least offer proper soy sauce!...More"
"September 19, 2015",30,Sushi on a shoestring budget,"AYCE dinner is $19.99, which is a good price for downtown Toronto. Food quality and presentation are average. Service is poor. This is not a high-end sushi restaurant with a 5 star ranking. Kyoto is a mediocre restaurant with okay food at an okay price."
"September 18, 2015",10,Worst AYCE Sushi Experience Ever!,The food tasted ok BUT not everything. The yam tempura was just the same as eating uncooked yam. The salad was swimming in the dressing. As for the service WORST customer service ever. First they gave us someone else's order. Then they tried to give...More

"October 22, 2014",30,Decent enough,"Been by several times and it always seemed packed so stopped in this evening. Well, it's an all-you-can-eat so you shouldn't expect awesome food so expectation met. The food was ok - some better than other. Service was ok, price was good."
"September 30, 2014",30,Decent food,The food and presentation reflects the price for sure. The food is decent so we go here when we don't want to spend much while having sushi that is actually good. We have been here a few times already and will return.
"September 20, 2014",40,Good sushi lunch buffet,"I was looking for lunch buffet with sushi/sashimi etc, however due to time limitation i didn't have time to search all restaurants in downtown, especially during 1pm lunch peak.

"July 24, 2014",40,Delicious,"Very good sushi and it was a decent price. There were many options on the menu, which was helpful since my friend hates sushi. He ordered a chicken dish and was very pleased with it. We randomly picked this restaurant since we were traveling and...More"
"July 23, 2014",30,At least it's cheap,"I don't know why we have to lower our standards so much for AYCE sushi, but this place clearly isn't interested in exceed expectations. It's loud, crowded, grubby and the food is mediocre. Most of it is edible enough but the salmon skin role and...More"

"September 12, 2013",40,Good Japanese fare,"Just had a lunch at this restaurant and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The food is reasonably priced, tasty and quickly served. What more could one ask for - well the decor is not too special but then for a quick and easy lunch that is...More"
"August 27, 2013",50,I love sushi,I stayed in Toronto over the weekend and researched Sushi restaurants in the area to where I was staying. I found Kyoto to have an all you can eat option and I told my wife we should give it a shot. It was a smaller...More

"February 14, 2013",30,Nice food!,"We went here with friends and our 1 year old. The only issue was that they hadn't got enough high chairs - but that was because it is such a family friendly place, they were all in use! The food was lovely and the service...More"
"November 12, 2012",50,Paradise for Japonese Food Funs....,"Fantastic sushis and others, highly fresh, very creative, tasty, ... simply excellent. Located downtown, close the Eaton Center.
