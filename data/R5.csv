The Chase Fish and Oyster,27-08-2018,20,Rooftop and then bar food,"Great setup, friendly staff but totally let down by quality of food. Octopus over cooked and very sparse on plate, and lobster roll was a con, should've been listed as salad roll with a little over cooked rubbery lobster - if you're lucky! Shame. Not...More"
The Chase Fish and Oyster,27-08-2018,10,Expensive and poor service,"The roof top is nice on summer day, but the service was so slow and not good. The food is over priced. A salad is $20, not big, not fancy. The salad was so salty. I couldnâ€™t eat it. I ate less than a quarter...More"
The Chase Fish and Oyster,19-08-2018,50,Another great meal...,"Consistency at a very high level is difficult to achieve, you have to work on it every day; clearly they do at The Chase. This was our 4th time dining at this lovely restaurant and it didn't let us down. Well done again!"

The Chase Fish and Oyster,25-06-2018,40,"Good food, limited menu, so-so service","There are only a few items on the menu, but they were uniformly good, especially the sushi-grade tuna platter and the chowder. Fortunately, the food easily made up for the inattentive service. Prices are reasonable for the quality and quanity."
The Chase Fish and Oyster,25-06-2018,50,Good fish,"Great place for an evening meal for friends, family, whatever. Great rustic ambiance, service and food and reasonably priced other than the wine. Lobster seemed to be what most people were eating and only the shells were going back."
