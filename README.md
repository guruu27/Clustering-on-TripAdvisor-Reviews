# Clustering-on-TripAdvisor-Reviews

I analyzed TripAdvisor reviews for the top five and bottom five restaurants in Toronto. 💼 TripAdvisor.com, known for its user reviews, provided abundant data for our exploration.

Project Highlights:





📊 DATA & SCRAPING: I utilized web scraping techniques with Beautiful Soup and Selenium to collect data. We gathered data directly from TripAdvisor.com.


🧹 DATA WRANGLING AND CLEANING: Employed rigorous cleaning processes to prepare the dataset, using pandas and numpy.


🔍 DATA EXPLORATION AND BASIC EDA: I analyzed in-depth exploratory data using visualization techniques, seaborn, plotly, matplotlib.


🧠 ENCODING METHODS: Applied advanced encoding techniques for text transformation and feature engineering using TFIDF and Bag of Words.


🔍 OUTLIERS DETECTION: Identified and removed outliers in review lengths for cleaner analysis using trimming.


📊 CLUSTERING: Utilized hierarchical and K-means clustering techniques for grouping similar reviews.


📈 EVALUATION: Evaluated clustering results using Silhouette Score and tSNE-based cluster scatterplot.
