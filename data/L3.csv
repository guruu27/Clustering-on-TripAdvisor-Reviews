Spring Sushi,19-09-2023,40,Fresh & delicious Sushi!,This was our first time having sushi and we loved it. We did the all you can eat and it was so fun trying all the different kinds of sushi. Their avocado rolls were so good! Loved being able to order from the tablet and the staff was so professional and helpful. The restaurant is located in downtown Toronto and there is a parking garage right across the street. So it's easy to get to. And it's great place to walk around and sightsee.
Spring Sushi,07-09-2023,50,Central Location,Food was excellent. Service fast. Just music was too loud: not suitable for groups who want to talk at the table.
Spring Sushi,10-06-2023,40,BEST SUSHI,"Amazing sushi. To me, the best in town. It is worth paying for the all-you-can-eat. They have a vast menu that won't disappoint."
Spring Sushi,06-06-2023,50,Magnificent!,".The combination of impeccable service, stunning ambiance, and extraordinary culinary offerings makes it a destination for food enthusiasts. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or simply seeking an unforgettable dining experience, this restaurant is a must-visit. I visited in May with friend from Poland. It was magnificent!"
Spring Sushi,14-05-2023,40,Sushi with a view,Sushi was excellent and came out very fast. Everything tasted great. Service was very good. They have an excellent location and I would highly recommend sitting on the rooftop patio if it's a nice day. Tip: make a reservation for the rooftop patio.
Spring Sushi,13-08-2022,20,Don’t accept debit cards,"The sushi was good enough, not excellent. It was also too expensive I think. But the worst thing is that they don’t accept debit cards but only credit cards or cash, and when I asked for the motive the waiter told me he didn’t know it."
Spring Sushi,15-01-2022,50,Take out done right!,"High quality sushi and sashimi, delicious maki (rolls) and super friendly service from Nick. We did pickup and enjoyed the discount. Sashimi portions were generous, they have sensible combo plates. Nick’s friendly and upbeat mood while answering the phone and when we picked up adds to the experience."
Spring Sushi,22-11-2021,50,Impressive Flavors!,"My partner and I ate here a few times and the food is pretty tasty and good. Sometimes it can be inconsistent in terms of presentation and taste slightly different but in general, the food in always delish!!  Service is pretty good and the wait staff are very welcoming and approachable!"
Spring Sushi,13-10-2020,50,Wonderful experience!,"We arrived at 8:30 pm on a Friday night. We had to wait till 9pm for a table but they took our phone number and called us when it was ready. They were very careful with Covid, taking everyone’s temperature and disinfecting hands. We got sat at the most amazing booth with a great view of the square below with all the tv screens, water shoots and buskers... the staff were all very polie and quick. The food was quick and very tasty! It was my daughters birthday and they gave her a free delicious crème brûlée! They are up to date in the latest technology even trying out a robot cart to send back empty plates!! It was not only a delicious meal but also a wonderful experience!"
Spring Sushi,01-09-2020,40,Amazing Rooftop Patio,"My friend and I went for dinner Sunday night and the rooftop patio is amazing! Food is on par with most all you can eat Sushi restaurants excepting they were missing a few items that you can find at most other Sushi restaurants excepting they have a delightful deep fried roll which most don't have. The only reason for the 4 rating is due to them being advised when I made the reservations that my friend is highly allergic to gluten which they said was no problem over the phone but seemed to be once we started to order as her choices were extremely limited and in addition the computer they give to you to order food was malfunctioning . As we were only ""allowed' 1.5 hours for dinner this malfunction in addition to their not being prepared for gluten free took up a lot of that precious time so our dinner was rushed for those reasons which was not appreciated and I felt lacking in customer service."
Spring Sushi,26-08-2020,50,Great!!!!,"What a great AYCE sushi experience!!!  My friends and I went there on a Saturday night during the month of August. We had a reservation since we heard this place could get packed fast.  Upon arrival, the hostess told us that we had 1h30 to eat since they have two different services. It was more than enough time, since their service is so quick!! The restaurant itself is very modern and the rooftop is decorated with plants everywhere, it felt very soothing.  The food is to be ordered on an iPad, and you barely have time to send your order for them to bring it to you. It is pretty surprising, considering how big the restaurant is and how many people they have to serve at the same time.  Everything we had was delicious, from the soups to the salads, to the sushis, to the grill or even the tempura items. The view on the rooftop is pretty cool, although hidden by bid buildings around.  My only issue is that they didn't have low sodium soy sauce, but despite that everything was delicious.  The waiters are very helpful, very quick and friendly. The price is totally worth it."
Spring Sushi,10-03-2020,40,Great Sushi,"Great sushi! Super fresh, great variety. Pretty cool location and ambiance. I loved the way you order the sushi on an ipad! They have an 'all you can eat' option for a good price....wish I was more hungry, so I didn't get that option. But we still got PLENTY! Great prices. Good drinks."
Spring Sushi,22-02-2020,40,Sushi Delight,A friend suggested that we meet at Spring Sushi for lunch while I was in Toronto. She had been there before and it was a favorite. It wasn't hard to see why. We made reservations but there was plenty of room for our party of four. We ordered a lot at the beginning and it took awhile for the food to arrive but it was worth the wait. Everything was fresh and delicious. I liked the mango creamsicle for dessert but my sister didn't. The price for all you can eat was reasonable. I would definitely want to go back the next time I'm in Toronto.
Spring Sushi,01-02-2020,50,Amazing sushi,Just amazing sushi. The white Tina scorched sushi restaurant as fabulous. So fresh. Excellent and friendly service. Will definitely be back.
Spring Sushi,19-01-2024,50,EXCELLENT DINER AT ONE OF THE BEST SUSHI RESTAURANTS IN DOWNTOWN TORONTO,"LET ME START BY SAYING THAT IS PROPABLY THE BEST PLACE TO EAT SUSHI IT DOWNTOWN TORONTO.
